## Outline

Icarus & Daedalus: The Labyrinth, is an expertly crafted 2D side-scroller adventure-rpg game based on the great and unforgiving Minoan Labyrinth. Home to the famous Minotaur.

The Wiki be outlining some of the things you can expect to see in our game. While we are hoping to release this month the game is still in a fairly deconstructed state so early access is about gathering feedback to aid in development.

## Controls

Icarus & Daedalus will follow the same conventional controls as most other games. Some interesting movements will follow this, however. Such as being able to roll to dodge attacks. This is a small mechanic that will introduce some skill into the game through telegraphing attacks. Those are: -
'S' and 'D' are your basic left and right movements.
'W' and 'SPACE' are your jump keys depending on your preference.
'S' and 'CTRL' are crouch.
'SHIFT' is to sprint.  
While crouching and pressing 'SHIFT' you will roll.
'E' is in the interaction button
'Mouse 1' is the attack button
'I' is the inventory
'TAB' is the weapon swap button
'1' is the health potion button
'2' is the power potion button
'3' is the scroll button

## Gameplay

The gameplay will take you through an intense battle with everything in the labyrinth that wants to kill, gut, and eat your corpses; but also the decaying minds of your protagonists: Icarus & Daedalus. The map consists of death traps and enemies lurking around every corner. Loot chests to obtain materials, and use those materials to upgrade your equipment. If you're lucky you may find new shinier equipment waiting for you in a chest. Defeat bosses for big boosts to stats through leveling up as well materials, items, and Minoan coins.

## Story

Icarus & Daedalus did not go without their own story in the iconic Greek mythos. This story is based on that with some story added to make it an absolute rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish.

### Overview:

Daedalus, a master architect, was responsible for the design of the great Minoan Labyrinth under strict order from King Minos. Built to imprison his enemies for good. One day King Theseus, a mortal enemy of King Minos, escaped the Labyrinth. King Minos, furious at his escape, blamed his escape on Daedalus. Accusing him of treason and imprisoning him in his own Labyrinth, with his son Icarus. His wife Naucrate made to be a slave to the king. His punishment, knowing that he may have to watch his son die in something that he had made, knowing that his wife is a slave to a horrific man. In the dark, with nothing but a torch, Daedalus must guide his young son Icarus out of the Labyrinth. Unfortunately, Daedalus is not aware of some lurking gifts that await them.
(Spoiler warning)

### The Labyrinth:

As you progress through the Labyrinth and eventually make it to the end where you will slay the Minotaur you will eventually build your wings and fly over the ocean to escape. As you bask in your glory a little too early, Icarus does what he was told not to do. As he is hit with a ray of scorching sun his wings melt and he plummets into the ocean. Falling from such a height he is knocked out and rendered unconscious. His father, Daedalus, plummets in after him and eventually drowns.

### The Chaos DLC:

Upon entering the first DLC you will see that both Icarus & Daedalus have been intercepted in the underworld by Hades who is pleading to help them escape as wronged souls have no place being damned. He explains that someone has been breaking demons and hell creatures out. Whoever it is, is helping King Minos gain his power and needs to be stopped. Through the map, he leads you to the exit. The exit to the overworld. However, as you approach the exit you are confronted by none other than Helios. The god of the sun. With the help of Hades, you will defeat him and move on up to the overworld.

### The Tranquility DLC:

You will trek back into Thebes where you hope to rid the city you once called home of its tyrant king, King Minos, and reclaim your wife from his dastardly grasp. Here you will hack and slash your way through the streets as his guards try and stop you. As you get to his massive throne room you will be confronted with some dialogue and your tied-up wife (and child depending on whether it's solo or co-op). You will fight King Minos in a huge fight. After doing so you will have freed the city and can now live happily with your wife and child.

## Characters

### Daedalus

Daedalus is the father of Icarus and husband to Naucrate. He is responsible for the very Labyrinth he was tossed into. He and his son escape the Labyrinth, help kill a god, and kill a king. Becoming king of Thebes himself until he eventually dies a peaceful death.

### Icarus

Icarus is the son of Daedalus and Naucrate. He is an unfortunate victim of a wrongful accusation toward his father. He and his father escape the Labyrinth, help kill a god, and kill a king. Becoming king of Thebes after his father passes.

### Aktis

Aktis is a man who committed many atrocities late at taverns all across Crete. He was eventually recognized after causing maybe his 100th fight with locals while heavily intoxicated. His fat stature and brute strength made him tough to take down combined with the numbing effects of alcohol. He was eventually taken and sentenced to the Labyrinth for his crimes.

### Nikaia

Nikaia was taught magic under the wing of her parents who had also learnt magic from a young age. She practiced at a secret school that was later raided by guards while she was not present. From then on her people needed to hide. One day she was caught using magic to steal food and was later thrown into the Labyrinth and labelled a witch.

### Naucrate

Naucrate is the wife of Daedalus and mother to Icarus. Another victim of a wrongful accusation toward her husband. Becoming the Queen of Thebes until her passing shortly after Daedalus.

### King Minos

King Minos is the ruler of Crete and is responsible for imprisoning Icarus & Daedalus in the Labyrinth as well as taking their mother/wife as his servant. He has taken a side with Helios to maintain power in Greece. He is nefarious in his way and has no trouble in removing anyone who gets in his way.

### Helios

Helios is the personification of the sun. He rides around in his flying chariot led by two dragons. Who leads Helios around Earth so he can shed light on everyone. He is the one who grants King Minos his power. Helping King Minos by stealing demons and hell creatures from the underworld and stowing them in the Labyrinth for people to be consumed by. One day he sees Icarus & Daedalus escaping and hurls radiant bolts of sun rays at Icarus to melt his wings. Causing them to crash into the ocean and ultimately die. Doing so to help King Minos in his cause.

### Hades

Hades is the ruler of the underworld. Troubled with someone letting free his creatures he begins to investigate. Seeing Helios take down two innocent souls he gets to work to help them escape and helps them deal with Helios so they can deal with King Minos while he takes back his creatures and continues his judgment. When Icarus & Daedalus escape and kill King Minos, Hades punishes him by making him judge the souls. Only being able to truly die when the very universe collapses.

## Enemies

### Spiders

Spiders are the most common creatures in the Labyrinth. Coming from all directions they are quick and will whittle you down with numbers!

### Crows

Coming from the skies to back up the spiders are the crows. An unlikely duo but in this case, they can be a huge pest if not dealt with!

### Imp

These flying creatures are extremely dangerous. A glorified bat with an axe in one hand and a curled fist in the other. If they group up on you, it's game over!

### Skeletons

Skeletons are a slower-paced enemy. They have more health, do more damage, and aren't as hasty as some of the other creatures. Perhaps it's the fact that they lack the guts. They usually have a sword or a bow.

### Gorgons

Gorgons are overly aggressive creatures that will happily bombard you with melee attacks. They hate nothing more than people with feet and hair. Maybe it's a jealousy thing.

### Harpies

Harpies are the imp's bigger brother. While they don't wield a weapon, they have huge 3-4 inch long talons on both legs and coverts along the top side of the wings. Very dangerous!

### Skeleton Mages

Skeleton mages will bait their brainless counterparts and do huge damage with spells. They generally like a good vantage point so they can enjoy the carnage.

### Orthus

Orthus are large 2 two-headed canine beasts with massive claws and 2 even bigger sets of teeth. They are fast and can do huge damage.

## Bosses

### Giant Spiders

Just like regular spiders only much much bigger and do much much more damage. Be careful to not get completely surrounded in this absolutely chaotic room.

### Skeleton Trio

This trio of skeleton warriors is not to be messed with. With hardened battle tactics and some gymnastics, they are sure to give you a real run for your money!

### Medusa's Sisters

Medusa's sisters are just as bad as she is. Boasting imbued bows that do tremendous damage and gaze that cannot be met for too long otherwise, you'll turn to sto...

### Cerberus

Cerberus is more than bite than bark. With 3 heads to rip you apart with he will not hold back.
The Minotaur
The Minotaur of the Labyrinth is the one who started it all and he isn't afraid to put an end to it. Wielding 2 huge axes and 2 large horns you better have a keen eye. Don't loose sight of him or it's game over!

## Inventory

Here is a screenshot of half of the inventory. On the right side of this menu is where the Crafting Menu will be. As you can see there are 4 separate areas to this menu. The left side has your wearable items. That includes your armour set, necklace, and 2 ring slots. The right side is your holdable items. That is a main hand weapon, an off-hand weapon, and a ranged weapon. The bottom section between the axes is your materials bag. That is where materials for upgrading equipment will be stored. When you die in-game and a run is ended, that bag will be dropped and you will need to return to the same spot in a previous run the get them back. The middle top section is your inventory for looted items that you find throughout the labyrinth. Not the most innovative inventory but it's not supposed to be a focus of the game. The focus is on an engaging story, intense combat, and cool loot. As well as being fun to play with mates. This is why we plan to have multiplayer support soon after release.

## Equipment

### Weapons:

Equipment will come in many different shapes and sizes all with unique values. Items will come in 4 tiers. The 4th tier is the highest and most valuable item. When you get an item, it will have 2 elements. A base damage, and sub-stats. Sub-stats are bonus statistics that the item gains. The amount of these and the values in them will be dependent on the item tier. A higher base tier item will come with more sub-stats and those stats can have higher values. This brings a unique element to the weapons in the game as they are all unique with their own sub-stats. Making looting quite an interesting adventure depending on what you can find. These items can be upgraded several times and can add sub-stats as you level them up, and can even add to the sub-stats depending on the tier to rack up some crazy damage.

### Armour:

The same can be said for armour. Upgrading this can drastically improve your survivability which is arguably more important than your damage output. Sometimes the best defense is a good offense though. These items are upgraded using material that you can find from the Labyrinth through either chests or loot drops from the enemies. Sticks, ingots, feathers, etc. Just be sure not to loose your materials bag or you could be in some real trouble if you're in need of an upgrade.

## Lootable Items

Weapons:
Some of the lootable items include Xiphos, Doru, Mace, and Bows. Each of these items has 4 tiers. A decrepit version, followed by a clean version of the item, then an upgraded version of the item, and then the best the item can be.

### Armour:

Some of the lootable armour includes leather, reinforced leather, Corinth, and pristine Corinth armour. Each set of this armour can be upgraded to give substantial buffs to survivability. It will almost be crucial to have this at max upgraded level to finish the game with a sort of ease.
Wearable Items:
Necklaces and rings will also be available as another added layer of buffing. Buffs such as damage boost, spell damage, speed, armour, health, etc. Will be available.

### Materials:

Materials can be looted from chests or enemies. They are what is used to upgrade your gear to progress further and get better and better gear.

### Potions & Scrolls:

Potions and scrolls are going to be some of your best friends in this hardcore journey. Health potions and other buffing potions can be just things you need to turn the tide of battle. Scrolls are a one-stop shop for a killing spree. Use a Fireball Scroll to absolutely eviscerate anyone on your screen or at least do a large chunk of damage.
