# **Icarus Beta Testing Wiki**

Welcome to the beta testing program! Your participation is crucial in helping us create a better gaming experience. Below, you'll find guidelines on how to contribute effectively to the testing process, along with rules to ensure a smooth and productive environment for everyone.

## **1. What is Beta Testing?**

Beta testing is a phase in game development where a selected group of players gets access to an early version of the game to help identify bugs, glitches, and areas for improvement. The goal is to ensure that the final version of the game is as polished and fun as possible.

## **2. Rules and Code of Conduct**

To ensure a smooth testing experience, we have a few rules in place:

- **Confidentiality**: Do not share any game details, screenshots, or videos outside of approved channels. This game is still in development, and we want to avoid leaks or spoilers before the official release.
- **Be Respectful**: When reporting bugs or giving feedback, please remain respectful to developers and other testers. Constructive criticism is highly appreciated.

- **Follow Instructions**: Follow the specific instructions given by the developers, whether it’s related to testing particular features or providing feedback in a specific format.

- **No Cheating**: Test the game as it’s meant to be played. Using cheats or exploits might skew the feedback and hurt the testing process.

- **Active Participation**: We value your time and effort. Please contribute regularly by testing various features, submitting reports, and participating in discussions.

- **No Sharing or Selling Accounts**: Each tester is given personal access to the beta. Do not share or sell your account access to anyone else.

## **3. How to Report Bugs**

We want to fix bugs as quickly as possible, and your reports help us prioritize. Here’s how you can make effective bug reports:

- **Describe the Problem**: Be specific! Include what you were doing when the bug occurred, what happened, and what you expected to happen instead.
- **Provide System Information**: Include details such as your platform (PC, console, mobile), operating system, and game version.

- **Screenshots or Videos**: If possible, attach screenshots or videos of the bug to make it easier for us to reproduce the issue.

- **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how we can replicate the bug.

- **Use the Right Channels**: Submit your bug reports through our official bug tracker or the forum we’ve provided for testers.

## **4. How to Give Feedback**

Your feedback is valuable! Here are some tips on how to provide helpful insights:

- **Be Honest**: Whether positive or negative, your feedback helps us improve the game.
- **Be Specific**: Vague feedback such as "the game is fun" is nice but not very helpful. Instead, explain what specific features or mechanics you enjoyed or didn’t enjoy.

- **Suggestions**: If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to share them! We love hearing creative input from our testers.

- **Be Constructive**: Pointing out flaws is important, but offering solutions or alternative ideas is even more helpful.
