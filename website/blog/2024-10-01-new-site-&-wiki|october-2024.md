Today we are excited to release the spankers website!

### Site & Wiki

The new website is a lot more glamorous and useful now, with the new wiki being the charm. The sight is fully searchable, containing everything for the Icarus side-scrolling RPG.

### Khloe of Thebes Release Update

We've been working hard on creating some pretty awesome and engaging content. And we are especially proud of the upcoming releases of **'Khloe of Thebes TTRPG - Campaign'** and **'Khloe of Thebes TTRPG - Alternates'**. Seth has painstakingly written and tested the game sessions, putting together an amazing RPG adventure, embodying Khloe's destiny among the Gods and Titans into a solid RPG experience.
As we get closer to release, new content will be added to the wiki. The **'Alternates'** pdf booklets will be released first, with the **'Campaign'** chapter by chapter on PDF and well known Virtual TTRPG servers. Printed booklets are on the cards but no news as yet.
