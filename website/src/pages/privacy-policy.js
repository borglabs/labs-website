          <p>
            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
            indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up

            store the personal information they provide in their user profile.
            All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any
            time (except they cannot change their username). Website
            administrators can also see and edit that information.
